Sockets
The client will send data to the server via socket. The server will process, calculate, and return the result to the client via socket. Communication must be done between two computers using TCP. You will need to capture such traffic in Wireshark. It is not allowed to use the same code as other students. In the assessment, the student must: (i) choose one of the work options below, (ii) make the program work and pass the test cases, (iii) make a good presentation, and (iv) know how to explain the code and the Wireshark capture.
